extractor/prose_to_plan.py — Orchestrator. Prose text → GenerateResponse.

The transform mirrors `streaming/response_shape._to_generate_response` so
the frontend sees a single shape regardless of whether the plan came from
the legacy `create_travel_plan` tool or from the new prose extractor.

Cost handling: per the v2 product decision we no longer compute exact
budgets. The LLM's free-text already mentions rough ranges in the chat
bubble, so `budget_recap` here is reported as zeros + `within_budget=True`
to keep the FE schema happy without surfacing a misleading progress bar.

Duplicate handling: we deliberately do NOT dedupe across days. The
upstream LLM is now trusted as the planner, and dedupe heuristics on
top of it caused more harm than good in the v1 pipeline.
